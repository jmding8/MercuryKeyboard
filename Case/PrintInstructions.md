# Case 3D Printing Instructions

* For wired, split builds, delete Body53_1 and Body54_1 to make room for the TRRS sub-boards to stick out through.

* The case is designed assuming PrusaSlicer. Cura handles thin walls poorly, and also treats adjoining parts differently.
* Use PrusaSlicer to open the .3mf file as a project file (and not as a pure geometry / mesh).
* The project file includes slicer settings which implement many tweaks and optimizations that help maximize print quality.
* The top part was printed from the project file. The bottom part was sliced more conventionally.
