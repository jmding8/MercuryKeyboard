# Mercury

Mercury is row staggered keyboard with 42 keys. It is primarily designed as a split, wireless, low-profile keyboard with multiple thumb keys. It can also be built in several other configurations including monoblock, wired, and with standard-height MX switches, but full feature parity is not guaranteed for these secondary configurations. If you are looking for a 40% keyboard with thumb keys and prefer row stagger then Mercury may be a good option for you.
