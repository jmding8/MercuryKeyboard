# Mercury

Mercury is row staggered keyboard with 42 keys. It is designed primarily to be a split, wireless, low-profile keyboard with thumb clusters. However it also supports several other configurations including non-split builds, wired builds, and MX height switches. If you're looking for a ~40% keyboard with thumb keys but don't want to train to use a columnar staggered layout or are worried about maintaining fluency with traditional keyboards, then Mercury may be a good option for you.
