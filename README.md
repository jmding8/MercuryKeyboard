# Mercury

Mercury is an asymmetric split keyboard with a 3x6 row staggered layout and 3 thumb keys per hand. Maye you're looking for a compact, fully re-mappable keyboard but don't want to go through the training period to adapt to a columnar staggered layout. Maybe you have concerns about maintaining fluency with traditional keyboards. Or maybe you're looking for a wireless, 40% keyboard with thumb-keys. Then Mercury may be a good option for you.
