# Mercury

Mercury is row staggered keyboard with 42 keys: 3 rows of 18 columns, and 6 thumb keys. It can be split as well, with each hand controlling a 3x6 + 6 layout. If you're looking for a ~40%, fully re-mappable keyboard with thumb keys but don't want to train to use a columnar staggered layout or are worried about maintaining fluency with traditional keyboards, then Mercury may be a good option for you.
