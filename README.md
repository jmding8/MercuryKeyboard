# Mercury

Mercury is an asymmetric split keyboard with a 3x6 row staggered layout and 3 thumb keys per hand. If you're looking for a 40%, fully re-mappable keyboard with thumb keys but don't want to train to use a columnar staggered layout or are worried about maintaining fluency with traditional keyboards, then Mercury may be a good option for you.
