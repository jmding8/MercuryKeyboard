# Mercury

Mercury is a row staggered keyboard with 42 keys that kind of looks like a pair of wings. It is primarily designed as a split, wireless, low-profile keyboard. Other build configurations are also possible, but full feature parity is not guaranteed. If you are looking for a 40% keyboard with thumb keys and a conventional row staggered layout, then Mercury might be for you.

With MBK keycaps, Mercury is 19mm thick from table to typing-surface. Its batteries are fully enclosed and protected inside the case of the keyboard. Default firmware is pre-compiled with a keymap that I personally use exclusively and on a daily basis.
