# Mercury

Mercury is a row staggered keyboard with 42 keys. It is primarily designed to be a split, wireless, low-profile (PG1350 "Choc" format) keyboard. Other configuraons are also possible, but full feature parity is not guaranteed. If you are looking for a 40% keyboard with thumb keys and a conventional row staggered layout, then Mercury may be a good fit for you.
