# Manufacturing Guide

 

## PCBs
1. The PCBs were designed with specific thicknesses for clearance reasons:
  * Logic PCB: 1.6mm
  * Base PCBs: 1.2mm
  * Plate PCBs: 1.2mm. This thickness works well with standard MX style switches, and with low-profile, Kailh PG1350 switches.
2. It is strongly recommended to have the diodes pre-soldered by the PCB manufacturer.
